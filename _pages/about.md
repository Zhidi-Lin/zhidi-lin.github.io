Hi there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="40px"> 

I'm **Zhidi Lin (林志地)**, a [Research Fellow](<https://saasweb.hku.hk/staff/zhidilin/>) at the University of Hong Kong (HKU) working with [Prof. Edwin Fong](https://saasweb.hku.hk/staff/chefong/). Previously, I was a [Research Fellow](https://www.stat.nus.edu.sg/people/research-fellow-assistant/) at the National University of Singapore (NUS) working with [Prof. Alexandre Thiéry](https://alexxthiery.github.io/) and [Prof. Jeremy Heng](https://sites.google.com/view/jeremyheng/). My research focuses on the intersection of control theory, generative modeling, and (generalized) Bayesian inference to tackle challenges in high-dimensional dynamical systems.

I completed my Ph.D. from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen) in 2024, where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Feng Yin](https://blsp-group.github.io/) and [Prof. Shuguang (Robert) Cui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1o_qvR0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). 

### Research Interests:  
My work focuses on data-driven modeling and uncertainty quantification, with a focus on: 
- **Dynamical systems** (Bayesian inference, data assimilation)  
- **Generative models** (Diffusion models, Gaussian processes, VAEs, etc)  
- **High-dimensional statistical learning** 
- **Applications**: Target tracking, fault detection, time-series forecasting, etc

I am passionate about interdisciplinary research and welcome collaborations with statisticians, AI researchers, and signal processing experts. If you’d like to discuss ideas or potential projects, feel free to reach out at **<a href="mailto:zhidilin@link.cuhk.edu.cn">zhidilin@link.cuhk.edu.cn</a>** or **<a href="mailto:linzhidi017@gmail.com">linzhidi017@gmail.com</a>**!
