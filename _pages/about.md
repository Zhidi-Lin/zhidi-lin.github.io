### 👨🏻‍🎓 About Me
Hi there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="40px"> I am **Zhidi Lin (林志地)**, a Research Fellow collaborating with Prof. [Alexandre Thiéry](https://alexxthiery.github.io/) and Prof. [Jeremy Heng](https://sites.google.com/view/jeremyheng/) on inference in high-dimensional dynamical systems using techniques from control theory and generative modeling.
Previously, I earned my Ph.D. in Computer and Information Engineering at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), under the supervision of Prof. [Feng Yin](https://blsp-group.github.io/) and Prof. [Shuguang Cui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1o_qvR0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Prior to my Ph.D. studies, I received my M.Sc. degree from [Xiamen University](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/) in 2019, under the supervision of Prof. Qi Yang and Prof. [Xuemin Hong](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xuemin-Hong). From Aug. 2017 to Mar. 2019, I was a research associate at [Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data](http://www.sribd.cn/en) (SRIBD), working with Prof. [Dongliang Duan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OEDs9p8AAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Liuqing Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dmOGdOYAAAAJ&hl=en).
