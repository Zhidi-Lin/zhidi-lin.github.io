I am currently working towards my Ph.D. degree at the [Hong Kong Polytechnic Univerity (PolyU)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/) concerning the related techniques of **Mobile Computing**, under the supervision of [Dr. Yuanqing Zheng](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csyqzheng/). Before that, I received my B.Eng. degree at the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), working with [Prof. Yuanming Wu](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/wuyuanming/zh_CN/index/173473/list/index.htm) for around 2 years and have accomplished several journal papers on the topic of **IoT Security**.


Born in a small town of Jiangxi Province, China, in the year of 2001, I was given the name "Xinyu (心宇)" which means that holding the whole universe in one's heart in Chinese. And as the name goes, I have shown great interests in exploring the inspiring world since my childhood: I am always fond of asking "WHY" and have numerous life hobbies including playing instruments (Saxophone, Violin) and doing sports (Basketball, Ping-Pong, Badminton). Moreover, I love thinking alone (sometimes may overthink haha...) and a am interest in Philosophy and Politics. Due to the broad interests about life, they are continuously motivating me to be a life artist, and that is also the reason why I decided to pursue my PhD degree.

My current research interests include but not limited to:
- Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)
- Ubiquitous Computing
- Machine Learning Algorithms
- Security and Privacy Issues
