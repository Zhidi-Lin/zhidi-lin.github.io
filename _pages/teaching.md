### Key Improvements:  
1. **Clearer Headings**: Replaced emojis with more formal section titles (e.g., "Academic Services" instead of "üè´ Services").  
2. **Consistent Formatting**:  
   - Used bold for course names and italicized instructor names for readability.  
   - Grouped repeated courses under a single heading (e.g., Linear Algebra TA roles listed together).  
3. **Conciseness**: Removed redundant phrases (e.g., "Undergrad Course" is implied by "Undergraduate").  
4. **Professional Tone**: Replaced bullet points with structured, hierarchical lists.
