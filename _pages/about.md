### 👨🏻‍🎓 About Me  
Hi there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="40px"> I'm **Zhidi Lin (林志地)**, a [**Research Fellow**](<https://www.stat.nus.edu.sg/people/research-fellow-assistant/>) at the National University of Singapore (NUS) working with Prof. [Alexandre Thiéry](https://alexxthiery.github.io/) and Prof. [Jeremy Heng](https://sites.google.com/view/jeremyheng/). My research focuses on the intersection of **control theory, generative modeling, and Bayesian inference** to tackle challenges in **high-dimensional dynamical systems**.

I completed my **Ph.D. in Computer and Information Engineering** at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-Shenzhen)](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), advised by Prof. [Feng Yin](https://blsp-group.github.io/) and Prof. [Shuguang Cui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1o_qvR0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). Before that, I earned my **M.Sc.**  from [Xiamen University](https://en.xmu.edu.cn/) under Prof. Qi Yang and Prof. [Xuemin Hong](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xuemin-Hong), and spent two years as a **Research Associate** at the [Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data (SRIBD)](http://www.sribd.cn/en), collaborating with Prof. [Dongliang Duan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OEDs9p8AAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. [Liuqing Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dmOGdOYAAAAJ&hl=en).  

### 📝 Research Interests  
My work focuses on **data-driven modeling and uncertainty quantification**, with a focus on: 
- **Dynamical systems** (Bayesian inference, data assimilation)  
- **Generative models** (Diffusion processes, Gaussian processes, VAEs etc)  
- **High-dimensional statistical learning** 
- **Applications**: Target tracking, fault detection, time-series forecasting etc

I am passionate about interdisciplinary research and welcome collaborations with statisticians, AI researchers, and signal processing experts. If you’d like to discuss ideas or potential projects, feel free to reach out at **<a href="mailto:zhidilin@link.cuhk.edu.cn">zhidilin@link.cuhk.edu.cn</a>** or **<a href="mailto:zhidilin@nus.edu.sg">zhidilin@nus.edu.sg</a>**!
