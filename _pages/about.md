I am currently working towards my Ph.D. degree at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic Univerity](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/) concerning the related techniques of **Mobile Computing**, under the supervision of [Dr. Yuanqing Zheng](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csyqzheng/). Before that, I received my B.Eng. degree at the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), working with [Prof. Yuanming Wu](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/wuyuanming/zh_CN/index/173473/list/index.htm) for around 2 years and have accomplished several journal papers on the topic of **IoT Security**. And during my undergraduate period, I has come to [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://cuhk.edu.cn/en) as a visiting student.


Born in a small town in Jiangxi Province, China, in 2001, I was given the name Xinyu (心宇), which in Chinese means "**holding the whole universe in one's heart**". True to my name, I have always been eager to explore the wonders of the world. My curiosity has led me to a wide range of interests, from playing instruments like the saxophone and violin to engaging in sports such as basketball, ping-pong, and badminton. I also have a deep fascination with philosophy and politics, often finding myself lost in thought. My diverse interests inspire me to embrace life as an artist, continually exploring and creating. This passion for discovery is also why I decided to pursue a PhD degree.

My current research interests include but not limited to:
- Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)
- Ubiquitous Computing
- Machine Learning Algorithms
- Security and Privacy Issues
