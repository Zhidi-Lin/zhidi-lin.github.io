I am currently working towards my Ph.D. degree at the [Hong Kong Polytechnic Univerity (PolyU)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/) concerning the related techniques of **Mobile Computing**, under the supervision of [Dr. Yuanqing Zheng](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csyqzheng/). Before that, I received my B.Eng. degree at the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), working with [Prof. Yuanming Wu](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/wuyuanming/zh_CN/index/173473/list/index.htm) for around 2 years and have accomplished several journal papers on the topic of **IoT Security**.
